egg-drop-message: "&8[&dRE:Dragon&8] &7The dragon egg has dropped at &b%drop-location%&7!"

# this is what the coordinates will look like
drop-location-format: "&bX:%x%&7, &bY:%y%&7, &bZ:%z%"

# set this to true if the first dragon on your
# server is already dead. if false, the plugin
# will check if there are end portals
# already in the end portal frame, then set it
# to true. This is to avoid a bug where the
# dragon egg will drop twice when the first
# ender dragon dies.
